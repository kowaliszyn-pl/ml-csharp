# Neural Networks Examples

This project shows the examples how to create and train neural networks using the NeuralNetworks library (https://github.com/kowaliszyn-pl/ml-csharp/tree/master/src/NeuralNetworks).

It contains the following examples:

- **Function data set** - demonstrates how to create and train a neural network to approximate a mathematical function.
- **Boston Housing data set** - demonstrates how to create and train a neural network to predict housing prices in Boston.
- **MNIST data set** - demonstrates how to create and train a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.
