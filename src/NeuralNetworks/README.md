# Neural Networks Module

Some classes are derived from the content originally published in the book Deep Learning from Scratch: Building with Python from First Principles by Seth Weidman. Some comments here are copied/modified from the original text.

# Visibility

All classes, interfaces, enums, and related types in this module are designated as *internal* by default to restrict their visibility to within the assembly. Types are marked as *public* only when external documentation via docfx is required. This approach ensures encapsulation while allowing for necessary documentation.
