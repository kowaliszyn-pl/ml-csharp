# Neural networks in C#

This project provides a C# library for implementing neural networks, including a variety of architectures, training algorithms, and utilities for machine learning tasks. It features modular components for building custom models, as well as example projects such as MNIST digit classification. The codebase is designed for learning, experimentation, and practical applications in C# environments.
